# Elden Ring Character Creation Randomizer

## Repository
https://github.com/XanderAcree/utd-angm2305-24_pfda-final-project-XanderAcree.git

## Description
It will -- upon clicking a button -- randomize the values for the character creation options for Elden Ring, and will output the randomized values along a bar of sorts (with small text popping up under it if the value has to be decreased because of a limit, basically following how it works in Elden Ring. This will be relevant to media and digital arts, 
in that the UI format will be designed around the theme of Elden Ring, so it actually lives up to its name of "Elden Ring Character Creation Randomizer", along with being able to use the outputs this program will give, and be able to actually use them in-game.

## Features
- Feature 1: Interactible Randomize Button
  - Will make the rest of the program run upon clicking the Randomize button (will incorporate pygame and any other 3rd-party libraries needed to make this possible)
- Feature 2: Randomized Character Option Sections 
  - Different sections (according to how it looks in Elden Ring) will be displayed (can swap between the different sections) with the randomized values.
- Feature 3: Image result of randomized options
  - Will use either gif or png spritesheet (will be determined as this final project is being worked on) to display the final result via pulling either the exact frame (or sprite if it's a spritesheet) to show how it will actually look if done in-game

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome: 
- Randomize button runs the rest of the program, randomized values for character creation adjustments are properly shown according to how the UI will be layed out, being able to swap between different sections of the character creation, and having the image of the supposed final result being displayed.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Have the Randomize button run the basic part of the program and ranomize values
  2. Have the basic structure of the UI done (not including the sections being interactible)

- Week 2
  1. Getting it to where individual frames/sprites from spritesheets are displayed for the final result of the randomized values
  2. Making the different sections of the randomizer interactible (so you can view the different randomized results, which will be different depending on if one of the options randomized might disable others, if it's an ON/OFF option)

- Week N (Final)
  1. Polishing the UI to make it more themed around Elden Ring
  2. Making any necessary final touches on the program before submitting it to eLearning
